Solutions I've implemented for most of the assignments of [Berkeley's CS61B Spring 2018 course](https://sp18.datastructur.es/).

What I did not implement:
- Project 2: I've found it so boring that I was unable to have the initiative to implement it.
- Lab 13 (Radix Sort): meh...
- Lab 14 (Fractal sound): couldn't bother either.

My favorites:
- Project 3 (BearMaps): Chef kiss...
- HW 1 (Sound synthesis): Hearing "Through the fire and flames" playing through your PC speakers knowing you programmed (the fun parts, at least) elicits a strange feeling.
- HW 5 (Seam carving): Simple to solve (not for me though...) and really interesting.
